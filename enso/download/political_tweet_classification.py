Contributors looked at thousands of social media messages from US Senators and other American politicians to classify their content. Messages were broken down into audience (national or the tweeterâ€™s constituency), bias (neutral/bipartisan, or biased/partisan), and finally tagged as the actual substance of the message itself (options ranged from informational, announcement of a media appearance, an attack on another candidate, etc.)
